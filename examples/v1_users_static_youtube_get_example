         "description": "A member of the Council and the very concept of Chaos, birthed by the world, itself.\nThe Gods appointed her Chairperson of the Council, but she mostly takes a hands-off approach as she has yet to accept the decision, much like her fellow members. That said, all of them have no intention of contending; instead to obey.\n\nHer mouse-like appearance has deceived many a fool who fails to realize that mice are the harbingers of chaos.\nAlso of note is her wild smile, which she often flashes in her frequent romps.\n\nChaos is confusion and disarray, it is fortune and tragedy, and it is freedom from all the logic and inherent nature of life.\nShe believes that rules are not the be-all and end-all, which is why she has come to break them all.\nWatching the aftermath is her greatest joy, and so she remains a bystander to the destruction caused by mayhem.",

With emotion and “other factors,” it is possible that her form may lean to either side. When that occurs, she bears a brief change in her appearance.\n\nShe does not speak of the events that preceded her second awakening. She faces ever forward, perhaps because she is Hope Incarnate, though no one knows for sure.

Whether or not that is true is something only those who have heard them can say.\nWhile she is usually affable, warm, and slightly mischievous, any who anger her will bear the full brunt of Nature's fury.",
